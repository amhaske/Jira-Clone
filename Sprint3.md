**Note**: All the APIs refactored as a result of JWT authentication that was implemented in the project. As a result user-id is not explicitly passed through the request body but is encrypted in the token which is then decrypted to retrieve the user-id of the user who made the request.

The token can be passed in the cookie
```
access_token=********; Path=/; Domain=jira-clone.com; HttpOnly; Expires=Mon, 04 Apr 2022 15:55:06 GMT;
```

OR as a **Authentication Header**
```
Authorization: Bearer ********.
```
# Updated Backend APIs Endpoints
- Any request that goes without token gets 401 status code in reply and response as follows:
    ```
    {
    "message": "ACTION_NOT_AUTHORIZED",
    "status": false
    }
    ```
- Any request with expired token gets 400 status code in reply and response as follows:
    ```
    {
    "message": "EXPIRED_TOKEN",
    "status": false
    }
    ```

## Test Case Refactor:  
<br/>
The code associated with test cases is in **tests** directory and is divided into three files.  

- **setup_test.go** : Creates a test environment(Mock Database, User Entries, Tokens) prior to running test cases.
- **tests_data.go** : Contains list of test cases
- **run_test.go** : Driver code that picks a test case one by one from *tests_data.go* and runs those testcases.

**How to run the test cases**: The test cases can be executed by running the command ```go test -v ./tests```

Rather than writing multiple test functions for multiple testcases which require setup of environment prior to running actual test code, the testcases were combined into an array of custom designed struct. The structure of a single entry for a test case that tests the API is as follows:
```
	{
	    init function,  
	    REST method - e.g. GET,POST,PUT etc) 
	    Actual API handler -e.g. "/api/sprint/delete")
	    Post Body, - e.g. `{"sprint_id":2}`)
	    Expected Status Code - e.g. 200,401,400 etc.)
	    Expected Response - e.g. `{"message":"SPRINT_DELETE_SUCCESS","resp":"","status":true}`)
	    post function(optional), - function that tests for changes happened in test environment after calling an API
	}

An example:
	{
	    func(req *http.Request) {
	    	// init function sets cookie into the request
		setTokenRequestInCookie(req)
	    },
	    "/api/project/create",
	    "POST",
	    `{"name":"Project 1"}`,
	    http.StatusOK,
	    `{"message":"","resp":{"project_name":"Project 1","project_id":([0-9]+),"created_at":"([A-Z0-9:\-\.]+)"},"status":true}`,
	    func() bool {
	        //Post function that checks whether the user entry is created or not in the user table.
